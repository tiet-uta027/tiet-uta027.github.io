#+RESULTS:




* Introduction
** Background

Object detection is a computer vision technique that
identifies and locates objects within images or
videos.   It goes beyond image classification by drawing
bounding boxes around detected objects, enabling
machines to "see" and understand their
environment.   This is crucial for applications like
autonomous driving, surveillance, robotics, and medical
imaging, where identifying object locations is
essential for decision-making and automation.

The YOLO (You Only Look Once) family is a popular
series of object detection models known for their speed
and efficiency.  YOLOv8 is a cutting-edge version that
offers state-of-the-art performance.

YOLO models are particularly well-suited for this task
because they process the entire image in a single pass
through the neural network.  This design choice makes
them significantly faster than other object detection
methods, enabling real-time performance.  Despite their
speed, YOLO models, especially YOLOv8, achieve high
accuracy, making them ideal for applications requiring
both speed and precision.

** Learning Objectives
1. Understand the YOLO architecture.
2. Set up a development environment for YOLO.
3. Prepare a dataset for YOLO training.
4. Train a pre-trained YOLO model on a custom dataset.
5. Evaluate the performance of a trained YOLO model.
6. Perform object detection on images/videos using the
   trained model.
** Dataset
Use the Pascal [[http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/][VOC Dataset]] which is available off the
shelf with both PyTorch and TensorFlow ecosystem.

The PASCAL VOC dataset is a standard dataset for object detection tasks. It defines a specific set of object classes that models are trained to detect. The classes in the PASCAL VOC dataset are:

+ Person :: =person=
+ Animal :: =bird=, =cat=, =cow=, =dog=, =horse=,
  =sheep=
+ Vehicle :: =aeroplane=, =bicycle=, =boat=, =bus=,
  =car=, =motorbike=, =train=
+ Indoor :: =bottle=, =chair=, =dining table=, =potted
  plant=, =sofa=, =tv/monitor=

Dataset preparation and annotation are crucial for the
PASCAL VOC dataset's effectiveness in training robust
object detection models. High-quality annotations,
including accurate bounding boxes and class labels,
enable models to learn precise object locations and
categories. Consistent annotation across the dataset
ensures that models generalize well to unseen images.

Proper dataset preparation, such as splitting the data
into training, validation, and test sets, is essential
for evaluating model performance and preventing
over-fitting.

** Software and Libraries

1.  Python 3.x
2.  PyTorch or TensorFlow (specify your framework of
    choice).
3.  =torchvision= (if using PyTorch) or
    =tensorflow-datasets= (if using TensorFlow).
4.  =ultralytics= (for YOLOv5 or v8).
5.  Recommended: Using a GPU for training.

* Tasks
Starter Code: [[https://gist.github.com/bvraghav/325de78ce4a705f12e940c7e29a2b06e][[IPython Notebook on Gist]​]]

** Task 1: Training the YOLO Model
1. Train the YOLO Model on the VOC Dataset.
2. Pay special attention to training configuration,
   [[https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/train/#train-settings][documented here]], or [[https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/blob/main/ultralytics/cfg/default.yaml][here]], and also listed under the
   title “Ref =model.train= options,” in the starter
   code.
3. Modify/ Update it to achieve better performance.

** Task 2: Model Evaluation
1. Evaluate the model under the following metrics:
   + Precision
   + Recall
   + Intersection over Union (IoU)
   + Mean Average Precision (mAP)
   The candidates are encouraged to use library
   functions /e.g./ [[https://pytorch.org/torcheval/stable/torcheval.metrics.html][PyTorch Eval Library]], instead of
   rolling off their own implementations.
4. Analyse the results and discuss the model's
   strengths and weaknesses.
5. Explain the confusion matrix.
** Task 3: Inference and Visualization
1. Capture 10-20 images from “your daily life” to
   qualitatively assess the performance of your model.
2. Visualise the results.
3. Analyse the results.
** Tips
1. You are encouraged to train the model in multiple
   runs successively improving upon it by parts,
   instead of a single pass.
2. Remember to [[https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/io.ipynb][save the model in a persistent storage
   device]], lest your endeavours be in vain.
3. Consider [[https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/train/#resuming-interrupted-trainings][to resume training]] from an earlier
   checkpoint.  Remember that your runtime might be
   limited with free cloud compute!  /E.g./ on Google
   Colab you may monitor the estimated available
   runtime under “View Resources.”

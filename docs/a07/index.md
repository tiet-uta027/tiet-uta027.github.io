A07 : Object Detection with YOLO
5-May/12-May


## Introduction


### Background

Object detection is a computer vision technique that
identifies and locates objects within images or
videos.   It goes beyond image classification by drawing
bounding boxes around detected objects, enabling
machines to "see" and understand their
environment.   This is crucial for applications like
autonomous driving, surveillance, robotics, and medical
imaging, where identifying object locations is
essential for decision-making and automation.

The YOLO (You Only Look Once) family is a popular
series of object detection models known for their speed
and efficiency.  YOLOv8 is a cutting-edge version that
offers state-of-the-art performance.

YOLO models are particularly well-suited for this task
because they process the entire image in a single pass
through the neural network.  This design choice makes
them significantly faster than other object detection
methods, enabling real-time performance.  Despite their
speed, YOLO models, especially YOLOv8, achieve high
accuracy, making them ideal for applications requiring
both speed and precision.


### Learning Objectives

1.  Understand the YOLO architecture.
2.  Set up a development environment for YOLO.
3.  Prepare a dataset for YOLO training.
4.  Train a pre-trained YOLO model on a custom dataset.
5.  Evaluate the performance of a trained YOLO model.
6.  Perform object detection on images/videos using the
    trained model.


### Dataset

Use the Pascal [VOC Dataset](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/) which is available off the
shelf with both PyTorch and TensorFlow ecosystem.

The PASCAL VOC dataset is a standard dataset for object detection tasks. It defines a specific set of object classes that models are trained to detect. The classes in the PASCAL VOC dataset are:

-   **Person:** `person`
-   **Animal:** `bird`, `cat`, `cow`, `dog`, `horse`,
    `sheep`
-   **Vehicle:** `aeroplane`, `bicycle`, `boat`, `bus`,
    `car`, `motorbike`, `train`
-   **Indoor:** `bottle`, `chair`, `dining table`, `potted
      plant`, `sofa`, `tv/monitor`

Dataset preparation and annotation are crucial for the
PASCAL VOC dataset's effectiveness in training robust
object detection models. High-quality annotations,
including accurate bounding boxes and class labels,
enable models to learn precise object locations and
categories. Consistent annotation across the dataset
ensures that models generalize well to unseen images.

Proper dataset preparation, such as splitting the data
into training, validation, and test sets, is essential
for evaluating model performance and preventing
over-fitting.


### Software and Libraries

1.  Python 3.x
2.  PyTorch or TensorFlow (specify which framework to
    use)
3.  `torchvision` (if using PyTorch) or
    `tensorflow-datasets` (if using TensorFlow)
4.  `ultralytics` (if using YOLOv5 or v8) or other
    relevant libraries.
5.  Suggest using a GPU for training (and how to set up
    in Google Colab, if needed).


## Tasks


### Task 1: Setting up the Environment (10%)

1.  Provide detailed instructions on setting up the
    environment. This should include:
    -   Installing Python and pip.
    -   Installing PyTorch/TensorFlow (with GPU support if
        available).
    -   Installing the necessary libraries (e.g.,
        ultralytics).
2.  If using Colab, provide a link to a starter notebook
    with the basic setup.
3.  Include a small test to verify that the environment
    is set up correctly (e.g., running a simple YOLO
    command).


### Task 2: Data Preparation (25%)

1.  Explain the YOLO dataset format. This is crucial!
    YOLO requires specific formatting of the annotation
    files.
2.  Provide instructions on how to:
    -   Download the dataset.
    -   Convert the dataset to the YOLO format (if
        necessary). Provide code snippets or scripts if
        possible.
    -   Organize the dataset into training and validation
        sets.
3.  If students are using a dataset that needs
    conversion, point them to tools or scripts that can
    automate this process.
4.  Explain data augmentation techniques (e.g., random
    flips, rotations, scaling) and how to apply them
    using the chosen library. (Emphasize why
    augmentation is important).


### Task 3: Training the YOLO Model (40%)

1.  Provide starter code or commands to train a
    pre-trained YOLO model on the prepared dataset.
2.  Explain the key training parameters:
    -   epochs
    -   batch size
    -   learning rate
    -   Optimizer (e.g., Adam, SGD)
    -   Weight decay
3.  Explain how to monitor the training process (loss
    curves, mAP).
4.  Encourage students to experiment with different
    hyperparameters to improve performance. Ask them to
    document their experiments.
5.  Include instructions on how to save the trained
    model weights.


### Task 4: Model Evaluation (15%)

1.  Explain the evaluation metrics for object detection:
    -   Precision
    -   Recall
    -   Intersection over Union (IoU)
    -   Mean Average Precision (mAP)
2.  Provide code or instructions on how to calculate
    these metrics on the validation set.
3.  Ask students to analyze the results and discuss the
    model's strengths and weaknesses.
4.  Require students to include a confusion matrix, if
    applicable, and explain what it shows.


### Task 5: Inference and Visualization (10%)

1.  Provide instructions on how to use the trained model
    to detect objects in new images or videos.
2.  Explain how to visualize the results:
    -   Drawing bounding boxes around detected objects.
    -   Displaying class labels and confidence scores.
3.  Ask students to provide examples of the model's
    output on test images or videos.
